# STEDI_AWS_Glue
This project to builds a data lakehouse solution on AWS that curates data for training a machine learning model. This involves extracting data from sensors and the mobile app, transforming it, and storing it in AWS S3, ready for use by Data Scientists. Using Spark and AWS Glue to process data from the STEDI Step Trainer and mobile app. Main tasks include extracting data from sensors and the mobile app, curating it into a data lakehouse solution on AWS using Python and Spark with AWS Glue. This curated data will be utilized by Data Scientists to train the machine learning model. 


### Project Environment and Configuration
Utilize Python and Spark in AWS Glue to process data, AWS Athena to query it, and AWS S3 to store the curated data.Develop Python scripts using AWS Glue and Glue Studio. Save the code to a local Github Repository for version control. Testing and running Glue Jobs require submission to the AWS Glue environment.


Some of the early adopters have agreed to share their data for research purposes. Only these customersâ€™ Step Trainer and accelerometer data should be used in the training data for the machine learning model.
