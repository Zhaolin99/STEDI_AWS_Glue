# STEDI_AWS_Glue
As a data engineer on the STEDI Step Trainer team, extract the data produced by the STEDI Step Trainer sensors and the mobile app, and curate them into a data lakehouse solution on AWS so that Data Scientists can train the learning model.

Some of the early adopters have agreed to share their data for research purposes. Only these customersâ€™ Step Trainer and accelerometer data should be used in the training data for the machine learning model.

### Project Process:

1. 
Create your own S3 directories for customer_landing, step_trainer_landing, and accelerometer_landing zones, and copy the data there as a starting point.
 Create two Glue tables for the two landing zones. 
(Share your customer_landing.sql and your accelerometer_landing.sql script in git.)

2. 
Query those tables using Athena, and take a screenshot of each one showing the resulting data. Name the screenshots customer_landing(.png,.jpeg, etc.) and accelerometer_landing(.png,.jpeg, etc.).
Create 2 AWS Glue Jobs that do the following:
Sanitize the Customer data from the Website (Landing Zone) and only store the Customer Records who agreed to share their data for research purposes (Trusted Zone) - creating a Glue Table called customer_trusted.
Sanitize the Accelerometer data from the Mobile App (Landing Zone) - and only store Accelerometer Readings from customers who agreed to share their data for research purposes (Trusted Zone) - creating a Glue Table called accelerometer_trusted.

3.
You need to verify your Glue job is successful and only contains Customer Records from people who agreed to share their data. Query your Glue customer_trusted table with Athena and take a screenshot of the data. Name the screenshot customer_trusted(.png,.jpeg, etc.).
 Write a Glue job that does the following: (*The data from the Step Trainer Records has the correct serial numbers. Fulfuillment(landing zone) is incorrect)
Sanitize the Customer data (Trusted Zone) and create a Glue Table (Curated Zone) that only includes customers who have accelerometer data and have agreed to share their data for research called customers_curated.
Create two Glue Studio

4.
Read the Step Trainer IoT data stream (S3) and populate a Trusted Zone Glue Table called step_trainer_trusted that contains the Step Trainer Records data for customers who have accelerometer data and have agreed to share their data for research (customers_curated).

5.
Create an aggregated table that has each of the Step Trainer Readings, and the associated accelerometer reading data for the same timestamp, but only for customers who have agreed to share their data, and make a glue table called machine_learning_curated.
