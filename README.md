# STEDI_AWS_Glue
As a data engineer on the STEDI Step Trainer team, extract the data produced by the STEDI Step Trainer sensors and the mobile app, and curate them into a data lakehouse solution on AWS so that Data Scientists can train the learning model.

Some of the early adopters have agreed to share their data for research purposes. Only these customersâ€™ Step Trainer and accelerometer data should be used in the training data for the machine learning model.
